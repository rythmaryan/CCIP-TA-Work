Problem Statement: Priyanka got an array as input and assigned a task to verify that the reversal of array gives the same array or not. If array and its reverse version both are same then print “ Verified” else print “ Not Verified”.

Input format
Given an array of size ‘n’ as input.

Constraints
1<= n <= 20

Output format
Print the ioutput as Verified or Not Verified.

Test Cases: ( 1 2 2 1: Verfied), ( 6 4 7: Not Verified), ( 1 8 5 8 1: Verified), ( 9 5 4 2: Not Verified)

Solution: 

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int i,n,low,high,arr[20],swap=0;
    cin>>n;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++){
        cin>>arr[i];  }
    low=0;high=n-1;
    while(low<high){
        if(arr[low]==arr[high]){
            low++;
            high--;
        }else{ swap=1; break;} }
  if(swap==1)cout<<"Not Verified";
  else cout<<"Verified";
    return 0;}
